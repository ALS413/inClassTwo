### Working with CSS transitions and animations

Recently, we covered CSS animations and transitions in lecture during class.

Previously, the only way to accomplish a lot of the things we do with CSS animations and transitions was through the use of javascript. Either through programatically making the animation happen or using some sort of event handler to make it fire off.

For this project, we are going to use the included HTML document to showcase some of what we learned. The CSS file is where all the magic will happen.

JS is not required for this assignment. However, if you want to add some other functionality by using it, go right ahead. CSS and HTML should be all that you need to complete this.

## Requirements:
 - create at least 4 CSS transitions. These can be on a number of elements, and you can transition any CSS property you want
 - create at least 1 CSS animation, using keyframes to make it happen (some common implementations of this include loading spinners that don't use any type of animated gif)
 - Use the book and/or the internet at large to complete these tasks
 - if you are implenting something you like form the internet, make it your own. Make sure to include a link to where the technique originally came from so I can check to see that you made it your own
 - you are in creative control on this one as well, just make sure the tranisitons and animation happen
 - you don't need to style everything on the page (just make sure it looks decent)

## Other Info
 - fork this repo (link available on github from this main repo)
 - clone your version (git clone {url for your fork})
 - make a new branch to work on (git checkout -b inClassTwo)
 - do your work
 - push the work to your origin (git push origin inClassTwo)
 - make pull request
 - if you're not a fan of the command line, you can still do all of this through github
 - fork, do your work in a folder locally, drag and drop the folder to the "upload files" interface (using the finder will not allow you to upload an entire folder) and when you are set to commit, make sure you do it to a new branch...it's an option after you upload the files, then make the pull request
 - there should be no reason to include any other files or libraries for this project

## Grading
 - make sure everything works, if the code is broken you will lose points
 - the pull request should be timestamped before midnight on Monday Oct 31
 - late submissions will be docked points as well
 - as always, let me know if you have any questions
